# Weather-App
A weather application that displays current weather conditions based on the user's location. Utilize Angular services to fetch weather data from a weather API (e.g., OpenMeteo API), Angular HTTPClient for making API requests, and Angular directives for displaying weather information. 

## Api Sites 
Open Meteo (for weather and air quality): https://open-meteo.com/en/docs
Open Cage Data (for geolocating, open meteo can also be used but I just wanted to try it out): https://opencagedata.com/api
